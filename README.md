       * Time Required: same as above
       * **Important Callout:** Some companies don't allow python as a coice in their online coding test, so prepare accordingly
</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size:1.15rem;">Data Structure and Algorithms</summary>

  * Without this, No Software Engineering Interview, in a tech giant can be cracked
    * Follow the DSA Crack Sheet List given below
    * Time Required
      * 2-3 months
      * 6-8 questions/day
      * 3-6 hrs/day

</details>

  * You need some projects to showcase your skills to your interviewer
    * Choices
      * Mobile Development
      * Web Development
      * Machine Leraning
      * Some other stuff (like, Blockchain, IOT, etc)
    * Time Required: 3 months (doing on weekends 6-8 hours)

</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size:1.15rem;">Subjectve Topics</summary>
  
  * Do a Subsequent reading, revision any day you get time
    * Operating System
    * OOPS, Object Oriented Skills
    * DBMS, Databse Management
    * Computer Networking
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size:1.15rem;">Competitive Programming</summary>

  * CP needs time, it's not somthing thant you can master in 2 months, We will get comfortable with online platorms and get a taste of competitive programming
  * Leetcode questions nearly 150-200 questions
    * Category  
      * Easy: 30%
      * Medium: 50%
      * Hard: 20%
  * If time allows then go for Codeforces div2 Level A,B and C question
  * Time Required
    * 150-200 Questions
    * 2 months
    * 3-4 Ques/day

</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size:1.15rem;">System Design</summary>

  * Tech Level
    * System's overview like we will use this queue with DynamoDB and a acheduler with justification of why we are using this DB, SQS, SNS, multithreading, etc.
    * for SDE-1 equivalent positions, this level is somewhat rare
  * Normal Understanding
    * knowledge of dividing system & creating a rough DFD of system
    * knowledge of DB Schema creation
    * able to create problem-solving logic or not
    * Time Required: Just need some reading of artiles/notes, can be pursued parallely
  * Great Resources
    * [Grokking](https://github.com/lei-hsia/grokking-system-design/blob/master/README.md)
    * [Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/README.md)

###  Notes and Resources
Lots of Notes, and Reading Resources picked from different editorials.

####  [CPP Data Structures, Algorithms, and STL Sheet](./CPP-STL.md)
####  [CPP Syntax Cheet Sheet](./CPP-SYNTAX.md)
#### Notes
- [Dynamic Programming and Bit Masking](./Resources/Notes/Dynamic%20Programming%20and%20Bit%20Masking.md)
- [Disjoint Set Union (Union Find)](./Resources/Notes/Disjoint%20Set%20Union.md)

<br />

###  [DSA Crack Sheet](./DSA%20Crack%20Sheet)
Data Structures and Algorithms Cracks Sheet contains most necessary questions to learn and grasp about most common and important DS and Algos 
  <!-- ### [Questions List](./DSA%20Crack%20Sheet) -->

<br />

###  [Companywise Interview Questions](./Companywise%20Questions)
It is containing the list of company wise questions available on leetcode premium.
Every pdf file in this repository corresponds to a list of questions on leetcode for a specific company based on the leetcode company tags. The list of questions within each pdf is further sorted by their frequency, so the most popular question for a specific company is at the top.
<!-- ### [Question List](./Companywise%20Questions)   -->

<br />

###  [Top Interview Preparation Questions](./Leetcode%20Top%20Interview%20Questions)
This is LeetCode's official curated list of Top classic interview questions to help you land your dream job. Our top interview questions are divided into the following series:

- Easy Collection
- Medium Collection
- Hard Collection
to help you master Data Structure & Algorithms and improve your coding skills.

Just like any other skills, coding interview is one area where you can greatly improve with deliberate practice.

Most of the classic interview questions have multiple solution approaches. For the best practice result, we strongly advise you to go through this list at least a second time, or even better - a third time.

By the second attempt, you may discover some new tricks or new methods. By the third time, you should find that your code appear to be more concise compared to your first attempt. If so, congratulations!

Remember: Deliberate practice does not mean looking for answers and memorizing it. You won't go very far with that approach. The more you are able to solve a problem yourself without any reference to answers, the more you will improve.
<br />

###  [Leetcode Daily Challenges](./Leetcode%20Daily%20Challenge)
This Challenge is beginner-friendly. It consists of daily problems given by Leetcode. 
A problem is added here each day.
